# Git branch workflow
1.) 'git pull' - Get the most current version of the master branch
2.) 'git branch' - List all the branches
3.) 'git branch <name of branch>'
4.) 'git checkout <name of branch>' - This will switch over to the created branch

# Now you can preform work on this new branch without touching the main branch

5.) 'git add . ', 'git commit -m "", 'git push' - To commit changes to newly created branch
